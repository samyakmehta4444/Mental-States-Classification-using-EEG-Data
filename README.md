# Mental-States-Classification-using-EEG-Data
This Model takes input EEG Brainwave Data and predicts the Mental State of and individual. We've used Google Colab as an online Interpretor for this Project. Since, we have data of 4 electrodes namely AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10, we've used all of them and created a 3D matrix of Data Points. Then, we have passed this 3D matrix through various Machine Learning Algorithms to get our final Results.

Till now this model predicts Mental States with an average Accuracy of 92%.
